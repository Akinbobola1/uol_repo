<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">3.2.1.1<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>You must first sign-up for an online account with us as an Individual Landlord.

If your accommodation agreement requires rent payments in larger instalments, we will collect our fee to coincide with these payments.  Any deposit collected via Our Housing Platform will be sent in full to landlords without deduction. The University will not hold deposits at any point.  We will use a third party payment company, Stripe Payments Europe Limited (“Stripe”), for transfer of the deposit. Further details about Stripe are set out in clause 8.2. Where you agree an Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement, you must protect the deposit within 30 days of the tenant making the deposit payment. </span></p>
