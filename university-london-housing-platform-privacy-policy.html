Examples of when consent may be the lawful basis for processing include permission to share your details with landlords or prospective tenants when you have given it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>8. Our Legitimate Business Interests</h3>
<p>We have a number of lawful reasons that mean we can use your personal information, including your consent, where you give it. One lawful reason is something called "legitimate interests". In general terms, “Legitimate Interests” means we can process your personal information if:</p>

<li>We are not harming any of your rights and interests.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>9. Consent</h3>

If you would like to review our Terms of Service, please refer to the following link: <a href="https://housing.london.ac.uk/about-us/policies-terms">https://housing.london.ac.uk/about-us/policies-terms</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where you are a student or university staff member:</strong></p>
<p>In order to provide you with the service, we will share your personal data with prospective landlords and agents who have property vacancies to fill. Landlords and agents will have access to your information, such as your name and details. Landlords and agents will be able to contact you where you have shown interest in their property. Landlords and agents will also be able to start live chats with you, where you permit this or initiate this. We will also share your information with your named guarantor in order to verify your information.</p>
<p>Where you have added other students or staff members to the same property, we will share your information with these additional students (subject to you initiating this request).</p>
<p>As part of your use of Our Housing Platform we may share your information with the landlord or agent, your guarantor and the third parties listed above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where you are a guarantor:</strong></p>
<p>Where you provide a guarantee for a student or staff member, we will share your information with the landlord of the property you act as guarantor for and where you act as guarantor on a joint tenancy agreement, we will share your information with the other tenants and guarantors for the property.  </p>
<p>We will also share your data with the third parties listed above. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where you are a landlord or agency:</strong></p>
<p>As part of the service, we will share your personal data with prospective tenants who are interested in your property listing(s). They will receive details of your property and your name. You will be able to liaise with tenants over direct chat and tenants will be able to contact you to raise queries and inform you where i.e. a repair is required in your property.</p>
<p>We will also share your data with the third parties listed above. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>11. Where do we store your data and what safeguards are in place to protect it?</h3>
<p>The data that we collect from you is stored by Our Housing Platform provider, SPCE Ltd, on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers within the European Economic Area (”EEA”). We take appropriate steps with a view to protecting the security of your personal information. We will treat all your information in strict confidence and we will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep your information secure once it has been transferred to our systems. We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information.</p>
<p>All information you provide to us is stored on these secure servers and any payment transactions are encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p>Please note that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>12. How do we conduct direct marketing?</h3>
<p>We would like to provide you with information about new products, services, promotions and offers from us, which may be of interest to you. This communication may occur by post, e-mail, SMS or telephone.</p>
<p>Where we need consent for this we will ask for it separately (outside of this Policy). Where we need to give you an opt-out opportunity before we send you our own marketing we will do so.  Any direct marketing that you receive from us in electronic form will also provide a simple means for you to opt-out of receiving further marketing communications.  For example, in e-mails we may provide you with an “unsubscribe” link, or an e-mail address to which you can send an opt-out request. We will take steps to stop any marketing to which you object or in respect of which you withdraw your consent within a reasonable period, but please allow sufficient time for the change to be administered.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>13. Transfers to other countries</h3>
<p>Your personal data may be transferred by us as data controller to countries and territories outside the UK and the European Economic Area which do not have the same level of protections for personal data as apply in the UK.  We are required by the Data Protection Law to ensure that there are adequate protections for it in those other countries and territories.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>14. How you can change your details</h3>
<p>You can manage your information and amend your details within Our Housing Platform by accessing your account. If you are a guarantor, you will not have a separate account, please contact us instead using the details contained in section 19.</p>
<p>If you stop using Our Housing Platform, your information will be retained on our servers and affiliated database for a period of time after which it shall be deleted. All data retention shall be in accordance with Data Protection Law and applicable law and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>15. What are your rights in relation to your personal data?</h3>
<p>The GDPR provides you with the following rights. To:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Request correction of the personal information</strong> that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
<li><strong>Request erasure of your personal information</strong>. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Object to processing of your personal information </strong>where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> <strong>of your personal information</strong>. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
<li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> <strong>of your personal information </strong>to another party in certain formats, if practicable.</li>
<li><strong>Make a complaint</strong> to a supervisory body which in the United Kingdom is the Information Commissioner’s Office. The ICO can be contacted through this link: <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/">https://ico.org.uk/concerns/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Access to information</strong>. You have the right to request access to or receive copies of the personal data that we hold about you. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us at <a href="mailto:data.protection@london.ac.uk">data.protection@london.ac.uk</a>.</li>
</ul><p>If you believe that any information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete and you are unable to change it yourself via your account, please contact us using the details provided above us as soon as possible.  We will take steps to seek to correct or update any information if we are satisfied that the information we hold is inaccurate.</p>
<p> </p>
