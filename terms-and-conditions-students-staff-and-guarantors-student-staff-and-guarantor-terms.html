<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">2.1<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>There are two types of properties that are advertised on Our Housing Platform:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">2.1.1<span style="white-space:pre"> </span><strong>Advertisement Only. </strong>These properties are generally offered by Letting Agents and Independent Halls of Residences and properties are advertised on a listing only basis. We do not provide any services in relation to these properties and we do not manage these properties.  You can use our Housing Platform to contact the advertiser directly to ask questions and arrange viewings and submit booking requests. Contracts and payments will be handled directly by the advertiser. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">2.1.2<span style="white-space:pre"> </span><strong>Housing Platform Supported Properties.</strong> These properties are generally offered by private landlords. These properties will also be directly managed by the landlord. However, you will sign a University of London approved accommodation agreement with your landlord on Our Housing Platform. Our Housing Platform will also facilitate the collection of deposit and rent payments to your landlord and offer a communication tool which will allow you to communicate with your landlord throughout the accommodation agreement period. Any deposit collected via Our Housing Platform will be sent in full to landlords without deduction. The University will not hold deposits at any point. We will use a third party payment system for transfer of the deposit. The landlord must protect any deposit taken in connection with an Assured Shorthold Tenancy agreement within 30 days of the tenant making payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">2.2<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>The terms in the remainder of this clause 2 do not apply to Advertisement Only properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">2.3<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>In respect of Housing Platform Supported Properties, you may enquire through advertisements by following the prompts on Our Housing Platform to obtain further details and arrange a property viewing. Property viewings will be carried out by the landlord themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">2.4<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Should you find a suitable accommodation, you can request to book this accommodation via Our Housing Platform and the landlord will be informed. Should they accept, an accommodation agreement will be made available for all parties to sign on Our Housing Platform. The accommodation agreements have been prepared by the University of London’s retained solicitors and copies of these are available on our website <a href="https://housing.london.ac.uk/sample-contracts">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">2.5<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Students and staff members will normally require a UK-based guarantor in order to be able to pay rent monthly. Please see Clause 3 for details of guarantor requirements. Should you not be able to offer a UK-based guarantor then the landlord may require that you pay an additional amount of rent in advance which will be indicated in the accommodation agreement. The maximum amount of advance rent that we allow landlords to request via Our Housing Platform is 6 months. We also allow the option for students and staff members to pay full rent for the entire accommodation agreement in advance if they wish. However, we do not generally recommend this option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">2.6<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>We facilitate your payment of rent to the landlord through Our Housing Platform. Please see further details regarding payments at clause 6 below. The terms on which your rent is payable is governed by your accommodation agreement entered into with your landlord.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.5755px;">3.3<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>The general requirements of guarantors for “Housing Platform Supported Properties” are listed below.
